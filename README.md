TextPaste
=========

TextPaste lets you create, edit and manage predefined text templates or code snippets (like a forum signature), which can be pasted into a textarea with a single click

Note: This extension is currently only usable for internal uses of infuse and needs to be modified to work elsewhere. We're working on a new script which will be usable just everywhere a textarea is.

Features
=========

- Add Unlimited Text Templates within a 3 Column Layout
- Categorize them in 'Text', 'Links', 'Plugins' and 'Snippets'
- Category Badges for better Overview
- Live Filter
- Works on ThemeShift and wpCasa
