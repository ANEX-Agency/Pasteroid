TextPaste
=========

TextPaste lets you create, edit and manage predefined text templates or code snippets (like a forum signature), which can be pasted into a textarea with a single click

Note: This extension is currently only usable for internal uses of infuse and needs to be modified to work elsewhere. We're working on a new script which will be usable just everywhere a textarea is.
